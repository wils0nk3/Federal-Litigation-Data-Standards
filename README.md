### 🛡️ Module Focus: Proving Systemic Conspiracy (42 U.S.C. § 1983, § 1985, § 1986)

This repository details the legal scaffolding for moving beyond simple misconduct reports to addressing **systemic abuse, negligence, and conspiracy** by public officials and their collaborators.

Our protocols are designed to gather evidence that satisfies the strict requirements for federal civil rights claims, including:

* **Circumstantial Agreement Protocol:** Standards for collecting data points across multiple cases or victims that, when aggregated, demonstrate a **"meeting of the minds"** or coordinated pattern of unconstitutional conduct.
* **Color of Law Mapping:** Verification processes that legally link the misconduct of officials (judges, law enforcement) to the **State Action** element required for $\text{§} 1983$.
* **Overt Act Logging:** Precise documentation requirements for logging the **specific actions** taken by individual professionals in furtherance of a conspiracy ($\text{§} 1985$).
* **Neglect to Prevent Criteria:** Analytical definitions to distinguish negligence from actionable **willful blindness** ($\text{§} 1986$).
