# 🏛️ Federal-Litigation-Data-Standards

**A transparent commitment to legal rigor and data integrity for civil rights claims.**

This public repository documents the **legal and technical requirements** that govern the evidence collection and analytical models within the private **Rules of Conduct Civil Rights App**. It serves as a commitment to ensuring that data collected is **court-submissible** in federal civil rights litigation.

### 🛡️ Core Focus: Systemic Conspiracy Claims

Our primary focus is to generate evidence that satisfies the elements of federal civil rights conspiracy claims, specifically under **42 U.S.C. § 1983** (conspiracy under color of law), **§ 1985**, and **§ 1986**.

| Legal Doctrine | Documentation Focus | Purpose in the App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Evidence Admissibility** | **Chain of Custody Protocol (FRE 901):** Standards for secure, timestamped, and cryptographically verified logging of digital evidence from capture to export. | Establishes the necessary foundation for introducing digital evidence in a federal court. |
| **Proving Agreement** | **Circumstantial Evidence Protocol:** Criteria for aggregating disparate data points across multiple cases or victims to demonstrate a **"meeting of the minds"** or patterns of **willful blindness** consistent with conspiracy. | Translates individual misconduct reports into evidence of **systemic failure and collusion**. |
| **Color of Law Mapping** | **Official Role §1983 Mapping:** Structured data models linking specific official roles (e.g., judicial, law enforcement) to the legal requirement of acting **"under color of state law."** | Ensures the App focuses on misconduct that meets the threshold for federal jurisdiction. |
| **Preventing Bias** | **Ethical Data and Bias Auditing:** Public methodology for testing and documenting the analytical models to prevent **algorithmic bias** when identifying patterns of negligence or conspiracy. | Maintains the **objectivity and credibility** of the analytical findings used in legal claims. |
